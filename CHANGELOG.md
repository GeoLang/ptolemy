## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- A write of 1000 rows or more refreshes planner statistics on `feature_versions`,
  `changesets` and `branches` after it commits, so reads served right after a bulk
  import are no longer planned against pre-import statistics. Tunable with
  `PTOLEMY_ANALYZE_ROW_THRESHOLD`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Initial release.
